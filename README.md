This project Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (Ensemble) by Janani V S (2025-08-24) is a complete pipeline for detecting anomalies in multivariate time-series data using an ensemble of Isolation Forest, LSTM Autoencoder, and PCA Reconstruction. The code handles data loading, preprocessing, and splitting into training and analysis periods, then trains the three models, computes anomaly scores, compares their performance, and generates an ensemble score for more robust detection. It also identifies the top 7 contributing features by variance, saves detailed results into CSV files, and produces multiple visualizations including anomaly score trends over time, comparison of mean model scores, severity distribution pie chart, and feature variance plots. The project requires Python with libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and tensorflow, and works with datasets containing a timestamp column and numeric features. Results include ensemble anomaly scores, per-model scores, top features, and plots, making the system a comprehensive solution for anomaly detection in performance management and monitoring scenarios.
